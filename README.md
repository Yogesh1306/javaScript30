# JavaScript30 Projects by Yogesh1306

This is my fork of the [JavaScript30 challenge](https://JavaScript30.com) by Wes Bos. It contains 30 mini‑projects built in vanilla JavaScript, HTML & CSS — each recorded day‑by‑day as part of the 30‑day coding challenge.

## 📁 Project Overview

Each folder corresponds to a single daily challenge:
- **Day 01:** Drum Kit
- **Day 02:** JS + CSS Clock
- **Day 03:** CSS Variables
- **Day 04–30:** Continue through the remaining 30 projects

## 🎯 Purpose & Learning Goals

- Practice JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation
- Learn how various browser APIs like LocalStorage, Speech Recognition, Geolocation, Speech Synthesis, etc. work
- Reinforce event handling, animations, audio/video elements, canvas graphics, and more
- No frameworks, no build tools — pure JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Browser APIs:** Canvas, Local Storage, Speech Recognition & Synthesis, Geolocation, Video/Audio interfaces
- **No dependencies:** All code uses vanilla JS — no frameworks or compilers

## 🚀 Installation & Local Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yogesh1306/javaScript30.git
cd javaScript30
# Open any project folder and run its HTML file in a browser
```

## ✨ How to Use / Demo

- Open each day’s solution `.html` in your browser (e.g., `01 - JavaScript Drum Kit/index.html`)
- Interact with the page as described by the challenge (e.g., press keyboard keys in Drum Kit, play video in Custom Video Player, etc.)
